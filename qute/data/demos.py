        num_folds: int = 1
            Set to a number larger than one to set up k-fold cross-validation. All images
            that do not belong to the test set fraction as defined by `test_fraction` will
            be rotated for k-fold cross-validations. In this regime, the training set will
            contain n * (k-1)/k images, while the validation set will contain n / k images
            (with k = num_folds, and n = number of images in the training + validation set).

        train_fraction: float = 0.7
            Fraction of images and corresponding labels that go into the training set.

            Size of one batch of image pairs for full inference.

        patch_size: tuple = (512, 512)
            Size of the patch to be extracted (at random positions) from images and labels.

        num_patches: int = 1
            Number of patches per image to be extracted (and collated in the batch).

        source_images_sub_folder: str = "images"
            Name of the images sub-folder. It can be used to override the default "images".

            Name of the labels sub-folder. It can be used to override the default "labels".

        seed: int = 42
            Seed for all random number generators.

        num_workers: int
            Number of workers to be used in the training, validation and test data loaders.

            Number of workers to be used in the inference data loader.
