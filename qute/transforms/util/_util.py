    Parameters
    ----------
    dt: np.ndarray
        The distance transform array.

    regions: np.ndarray
        The region array.

    in_place: bool (Optional)
        Specifies whether the scaling should happen in place. Default is False.

    reverse: bool
        Whether to reverse the direction of the normalized distance transform: from 1.0 at the center of the
        objects and 0.0 at the periphery, to (close to) 0.0 at the center and 1.0 at the periphery.

    do_not_zero: bool
        This is only considered if `reverse` is True. Set to True not to allow that the center pixels in each
        region have an inverse distance transform of 0.0.

    Returns
    -------
    The updated distance transform array.
